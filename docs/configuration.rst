Configuration
=============

The default settings should be enough for most of the cases.
Although, if you have special requirements this section may help you tune up a little the extension to make it work as you need.

There are several settings that you can customize in your ``conf.py`` file,


notfound_template (str)
    Template used to render the ``404.html`` generated by this extension.
    Default ``'page.html'``.

notfound_context (dict)
    Context passed to the template defined by ``notfound_template``.
    Default ``{'title': 'Page not found', 'body': '<h1>Page not found</h1>\n\nThanks for trying.'}``.

notfound_pagename (str)
    Page name generated by the extension. Default ``'404'``.

notfound_default_language (str)
    Language used as default to generate all the links to the resources.
    Default ``'en'``.

    All the links generated will have this prefix (e.g. ``/en/``).
    This configuration works together with ``notfound_default_version``.

notfound_default_version (str)
    Version used as default to generate all the links to the resources.
    Default ``'latest'``.

    All the links generated will have this prefix (e.g. ``/latest/``).
    This configuration works together with ``notfound_default_version``.

    .. tip::

       As a example, if we have a resource at ``_static/js/logic.js``
       and we generate a 404 page with the default settings,
       the URL resulting will be ``/en/latest/_static/js/logic.js``.

notfound_no_urls_prefix (bool)
    Do not add URLs prefixes. If this option is set to ``True``,
    The prefix values mentioned (``notfound_default_language`` and ``notfound_default_version``)
    won't be prefixed to the URLs.
    Default ``False``.
