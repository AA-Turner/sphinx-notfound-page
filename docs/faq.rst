Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Does this extension work with Read the Docs?
--------------------------------------------

Yes.

Read the Docs should detect the ``404.html`` page generated by the extension automatically,
and serve it when a user hits a not found page.

If you are using a Single Version project, you may want to set ``notfound_no_urls_prefix`` to ``True``.


Does this extension work with GitHub pages?
-------------------------------------------

Yes.

You may want to set ``notfound_no_urls_prefix`` to ``True`` and then add ``permalink: /404.html`` in the `YAML front matter`_.

.. _YAML front matter: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/


WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
-----------------------------------------------

This warning is risen by Sphinx when building the docs because the ``404.rst`` is not included in any toctree.
If you want to remove this warning, you need to add ``:orphan:`` (see `full docs`_) at the top of the ``404.rst`` file.
